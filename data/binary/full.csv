The most immediate side-effect noticed was extreme stomach discomfort.	1	0	0	0	0	0
It's not like a sore stomach, but it feels like your abdomen is tensed up, which I initially mistook for a sign of additional anxiety, However, according to my doctor this tension in the stomach area is purely a chemical reaction to the medicine and not connected with an emotional state.	1	0	0	0	0	0
His notion is validated by my increased ability to sleep, which is never possible if I'm anxious.	0	0	1	0	1	1
This stomach discomfort has faded about 75%, as my body acclimates to the drug.	1	0	0	0	0	0

it would be worth your while to do some research about neurotransmitters, etc I have found that medical trends fail to recognize how dangerous these medications can be; the medical community is saturated by mass loads of marketing by pharmecutical companies, which I think is sad because any seller WILL MOST LIKELY NOT state side effects, in an effort to sell the drug.	0	0	0	0	0	0
It's very sad, but it proves to me that medicine is just a money making field, instead of a people helping field.	0	0	0	0	0	0

The depression lifted a bit but the anxiety, head pressure, dizziness, insomnia were unbearable.	1	0	1	0	1	1

Reading through this yes the side effects have been awful and pretty persistent but I'll now explain below.	1	0	0	0	0	0
Basically I anise these tablets no end and take up to 800-1000mg hence all the side effects, but because I abused them so heavily at the start a normal dose now gives me withdrawal which gives all the above side effects.	0	1	0	0	0	0

After a few weeks on Zoloft it was amazing to me the way I felt (that is , not constantly depressed).	0	0	1	0	1	1
I think it did make me sleepy because I was constantly napping, but that may also partly have been carried over from when I was depressed and unmedicated (I slept to avoid how I was feeling).	1	0	0	0	1	0
After a year or so I realized I didn't have much of a libido anymore and after about 2.5 years on Zoloft I finally changed my medication, but if it wasn't for that side effect, I most likely would have stayed on it.	1	0	0	0	0	0

 My lawyer will be contacting you.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Cymbalta has the same adverse side effects of the other SSRI medications and then some.	1	0	0	0	0	0
In fact, because of Cymbaltas adverse emotional reactions, the inherent inability to get an erection or orgasm that is more the norm in other SSRI medications appears to be even worse with this one.	1	0	0	0	0	0
If that werent enough, it increases anxiety and thus has less value as an anti-depressant.	1	0	0	1	1	1
Yet what was even more profound, I found that I was in a state of emotional upset at all times but wasnt aware of it until I stopped the medication 6 days ago.	1	0	0	0	0	0
Bizarre sensations of profound guilt and regret about incidents from the past (childhood to adult), were constantly re-lived and extremely inflated to say the least.	1	0	0	0	0	0
I found myself on the verge of tears at all times.	1	0	0	1	0	0
To add to the constant emotional upset, I can now attribute Cymbalta to frustrating memory lapses and a dramatic compromise in my cognitive abilities which I had mistakenly blamed on my pain medication.	1	0	0	0	0	0
This drug caused me t. I have severe and chronic lower back pain with Fibromyalgia which resulted in my developing depression.	0	0	0	0	1	0
Consequently, I was placed on anti-depressants to counteract the side effects of pain medication, and also because the constant pain sucked the life out of me.	0	0	0	0	1	1
Initially I was on Effexor (YIKES!	0	0	0	0	0	0
), but had to stop this drug after only a few days.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Subsequently I was placed on Zoloft for several years, then Celexa for several more, and finally Cymbalta in an effort to decrease the SSRI side effects the first two medications had.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Each time I switched drugs I had to stop completely to start the other.	0	0	0	0	0	0
I had no adverse withdrawal side effects from either Zoloft or Celexa; however Cymbalta was a different story.	0	0	0	0	0	0
I had tried several times before to quit Cymbalta but because of the extreme withdrawal side effects, I was forced to stay on it.	0	1	0	0	0	0
The evidence for me is irrefutable; Cymbalta has absolutely no redeeming value when compared to any other type of SSRI anti-depressant.	0	0	0	1	0	0
In Fact, I believe it should either be removed from the market or be deemed a controlled substance, not because patients would be inclined to abuse this drug, but that physicians are in an effort to improve mood and block pain without having to dispense pain medication.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Even the most innocuous of prescribed pain medication has vastly more therapeutic value, simply because Cymbalta has none.	0	0	0	1	0	0

started out on 60mg, which was a way too high dosage to start out on- lay on my bed for 2 days staring at the ceiling, not being able to move; also experienced blurred vision, nausea, excessive sleepiness, yet inability to sleep - Was so paranoid after this episode that I didn't take it for a month again, but t my doctor recommended that I rather slowly get used to the drug, taking 30 mg every second day, and gradually increasing the dosage - Second time round the side effects in the first week were minimal and even quite pleasant- had so much energy that I could get by with 4 hours sleep.	1	0	1	1	0	0
This stabilised later on though - As I upped my dosage, my libido started taking strain though and I had trouble sleeping - At 60mg, I started experiencing excessive sleepiness, needing a nap at least once every afternoon.	1	0	0	0	0	0

At 60mg however, my sleepiness just became unbearable.	1	0	0	0	0	0

Racing brain, not sleep well, dry mouth, sexual disfunction, bad memory, bad dreams, endless energy.	1	0	0	0	0	0
All medicines have side effects!	0	0	0	0	0	0
it is how it effects the individual in different ways.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Up until now I have been taking Endep for the pain and neuropathy and Citropalapram for depression.	0	0	0	0	1	1
These drugs both had similar side effects to Cymbalta and hard to withdraw from with bad withdrawal symptoms the only difference is the Endep knocked me out at night and I slept well, only very drousy and tired during the day, sexual disfunction just the same.	0	1	0	0	0	0
So I figure in my mind that having one tablet to take and only pay for just one lot of medication ($34.20Aud) has to have a plus and only one set of side effects and withdrawal symptoms to cope with is even more a plus.	0	0	0	0	0	0
By the way, with Citropalapram had endless energy for the first year or so then just felt worn out and tired after that.	0	0	1	1	0	0
Having said that also, it saved my life as I was so bad before taking the drugs all I wanted to do was die to stop the dark depression and pain, so I think I have done well.	0	0	1	0	1	1

I would encourage you to speak to your doctor right away if some of those really bad side effects occur - this drug is so new, there's no long term studies on it, so we don't know how it reacts with different symptoms, different physiology.	0	0	0	0	0	0

The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side effects, My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.	1	0	0	0	0	0
I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.	0	0	0	0	0	0

I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.	0	0	0	0	0	0
