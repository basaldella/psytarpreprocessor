started out on 60mg, which was a way too high dosage to start out on- lay on my bed for 2 days staring at the ceiling, not being able to move; also experienced blurred vision, nausea, excessive sleepiness, yet inability to sleep - Was so paranoid after this episode that I didn't take it for a month again, but t my doctor recommended that I rather slowly get used to the drug, taking 30 mg every second day, and gradually increasing the dosage - Second time round the side effects in the first week were minimal and even quite pleasant- had so much energy that I could get by with 4 hours sleep.	1	0	1	1	0	0
